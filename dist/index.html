				<p>Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.</p>
				<p>Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage. Han! Luke! Are you all right? Fine. Together again, huh? Wouldn't miss it. How are we doing? The same as always. That bad, huh? Where's Leia? I'm here. Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. Good, I hate long waits. You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. Doesn't sound so bad. In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. On second thought, let's pass on that, huh? You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.</p>
